INSIGHT 

1: Rail Has the Highest Average Usage
•	Among all service types, Rail consistently records the highest average number of daily journeys.
•	This indicates it is the most utilized mode of public transport, likely due to fixed routes and reliability.
2: Peak Usage Happens on Weekdays
•	Public transport usage is significantly higher on weekdays, especially for:
1.	Peak Service
2.	Local Route
3.	Rapid Route
•	Weekend usage noticeably drops, suggesting commuter-driven demand.
3: School Transport Has Sharp Peaks and Troughs
•	School services show highly irregular patterns:
1.	Sharp spikes during school terms
2.	Very low or zero usage during holidays
•	This pattern reflects academic calendars and can aid in term-time planning.
4: Overall Demand Has Seasonal Trends and Spikes
•	The overall number of journeys shows a seasonal pattern:
1.	Certain months (likely tied to weather or events) show higher public transport usage.
2.	Random daily spikes suggest special events or transit promotions.

Technical Report: Additive Time Series Forecasting using Facebook Prophet
Objective
Forecast the daily passenger journeys for the next 7 days for five types of public transport services:
•	Local Route
•	Light Rail
•	Peak Service
•	Rapid Route
•	School

Chosen Algorithm: Additive Time Series Model (via Facebook Prophet)
Facebook Prophet is an open-source time series forecasting library developed by Meta. It implements an additive model with components for trend, seasonality, and holiday effects:
Why Prophet?
Prophet is ideal for time series that:
•	Have strong seasonal patterns (e.g., weekdays vs weekends)
•	Require quick deployment and interpretability
•	Contain missing data or outliers
•	Are daily or hourly in frequency
These conditions match our dataset perfectly
Model Parameters Used
Parameter	Description
trend	Automatically detected, linear by default
seasonality_mode	'additive' (suitable when seasonal effects are constant over time)
changepoint_prior_scale	0.05 (default) – controls flexibility of trend changes
forecast horizon	7 days
Results Summary
•	Separate models were trained for each service type using historical daily journey counts.
•	All services showed distinct weekly seasonality, especially Peak and School services.
•	Light Rail and Rapid Route exhibited stable trends; School service was highly periodic (reflecting school terms).
